To run api project, you will need .NET CORE 2.1 SDK.
Database connection string can be found in `api/Services/Registry.cs`
To apply migration to database run `dotnet ef database update` in `api/DataAccess`

For SPA you will need yarn or npm and node.js
in `frontend` folder run `yarn` or `npm install` when packages are ready run `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Let me know if you'll have any problems.
